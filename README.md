# HOW TO:

  a)Either make your own usernames.txt list of usernames that follow their twitter account
  
  b)Get usernames by signing up to https://www.magimetrics.com/welcome/how-to-export-an-instagram-account.html once you've signed up simply download a list of 100 followers of their account for free. Once you have it name it 100_followers.csv then run csvToTXT.py which will move the usernames you extracted using magimetrics to usernames.txt.
